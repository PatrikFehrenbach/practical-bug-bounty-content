# Folder Structure üìÇ

- Each `module` is a directory.
- Within each `module`, there are `submodules`, which are also directories.
- Each `submodule` contains `topics`, which are again directories.
- Each topic directory can have:
 - `info.json`: Contains metadata about the topic.
 - `videos.json`: Contains a list of video references associated with the topic.
 - `notes.md`: Contains any textual notes or additional information about the topic.
 - `links.json`: Contains a list of external links related to the topic.



üåü How to Generate New Content
Creating exciting and valuable content is as easy as a few simple steps. Let's dive into the magical world of content creation! ‚ú®üìö

1.Navigate to the desired location in the folder structure.
2.Modify existing files or add new files as required. Ensure you follow the structure mentioned above.
3.Once you've added or modified content, navigate to the repository root and run the converter script:

```python
python3 folder_to_json_converter.py
```

ü™Ñ This script will traverse the folder structure, collecting data, and generating a Django-compatible JSON dump.

# üå† Examples
## üöÄ Detailed Example: Generating an Entire Module

In this adventure, we'll create a new module called `Web Security`, a submodule named `XSS Attacks`, and a topic named `Reflected XSS`. Let's embark on this epic quest! üõ°Ô∏èüéØ

### 1. Creating a New Module

- Navigate to the root content directory
- Create a directory named `Web Security`.

### 2. Adding a Submodule

- Within the `Web Security` directory.
- Create a directory named `XSS Attacks`.

### 3. Adding a Topic

- Inside the `XSS Attacks` directory.
- Create a directory named `Reflected XSS`.
Craft
### 4. Adding Metadata to the Topic

- Inside the Reflected XSS directory, pen down a file named `info.json`.
- Add the following content to `info.json` :
```json
{
  "description": "An introduction to RRemember to run the converter script after making changes to generate an updated JSON dump.eflected XSS attacks."
}
```

### 5. Adding Videos to the Topic

Within the Reflected XSS directory, create a file named `videos.json`.
Add the following content to `videos.json` :
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Understanding Reflected XSS",
    "url": "https://youtube.com/examplelink1"
  }
]
```

### 6. Adding Notes to the Topic

- Create a file named `notes.md` in the same directory.
- Add your notes. For example:

```md
# Reflected XSS

Reflected XSS attacks are a type of XSS where the injected script is reflected off a web server.
```
### 7. Adding External Links

- Create a file named `links.json`.
- Add the following content:

```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://security.example.com/reflected-xss",
    "description": "Deep dive into Reflected XSS"
  }
]
```

### Adding a New Module

1. Create a new directory in the root folder with the module name.
2. Inside the module directory, you can add submodules as directories.
3. Each submodule can then have topics, and so on.

### Modifying a Topic

1. Navigate to the desired topic directory.
2. Open `info.json` to modify metadata, `videos.json` to add or modify videos, `notes.md` to edit notes, and `links.json` to update external links.

Please remember to execute the converter script after each modification to produce an up-to-date JSON dump.
